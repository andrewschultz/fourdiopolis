The game is made up of 6 lists you need to work through.

First, you see your friends.

Then, you get a random assignment. Supplies, disgruntled people or education.

Once you complete all three, you unlock the cool stuff.

Once you unlock the cool stuff, you have the option to go after last names, which is meant to be very hard indeed.

Before spoiling everything, my advice is: try to knock off the small stuff first. See how the teleporters displace you.













































Here is how to find your friends, in alphabetical order.
