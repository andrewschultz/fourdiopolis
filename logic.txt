Fourdiopolis Logic Document

by Andrew Schultz

This contains spoilers for Fourdiopolis. You may wish to play Threediopolis first.

The new directions are H, I, J and K. But what do they mean?

First, NSEWUD behave as before.

Also, you are told that you have to use a transporter. So what do transporters do? They provide diagonal, nonreversible transport through the city.

H = +2 +2 +2
I = +2 -2 -2
J = -2 +2 -2
K = -2 -2 +2

These are sort of based on the quaternions, or half of them. Note h+i+j+k=0, but really, you won't need to use that many of these letters.

Another thing to note is, super near = 3 characters. You can find this by focusing on friends.

Who is at 56a? That is 2D, 1S and 3E. If you assume there are 3 characters, then K must be one. That leaves 1N 1E.

ENK = Ken.

In general, you can figure the HIJK letters of a word from its general area.

HSSEE = KNNWW
HSSDD = INNUU

HDDEE = JUUWW

=======================================

The logic of Fourdiopolis is a bit trickier than Threediopolis, but there are a lot more hints.

The first thing to notice is that you can always know whether you have an odd number of teleporters or an even number. This is due to a parity argument.

If we count A as -1, B as -2, etc., every physical square travelled switches the sum of coordinates from even to odd or vice versa. But a teleporter does not. So if you have seven moves to get somewhere, and it is on odd coordinates, you must hit an even number of teleporters. Since Fourdiopolis's locations are all past a teleporter, you must have hit at least two.

Now it is a bit tricky to find out when two things might overlap. For three letters, there is only one possibility, well, mirrored. Fortunately, the letter lumping involved means that it's pretty easy to determine what works, for short words.

HIW=EEE
HJS=NNN
HKD=UUU





You can also notice that anything under five letters is fixed. Any combination of two teleportals is 8 away from another, walking. Therefore, anything with two different teleportals and three steps cannot reach another.

H+H = 4 4 4
H+I = 4 0 0
H+J = 0 4 0
H+K = 0 0 4
I+I = 4 -4 -4
I+J = 0 0 -4
I+K = 0 -4 0
J+J = -4 4 -4
J+K = 0 -4 0
K+K = -4 -4 4
K+L = -4 4 4

This should help you clear out the basics. The rest is trickier, since there may be overlap. That's how to solve Fourdiopolis in a nutshell.
