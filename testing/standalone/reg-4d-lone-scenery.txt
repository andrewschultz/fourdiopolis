Wow! People seem to be having a rip-roaring time, here. You don't have time for such carousing at the moment, but it boosts your spirits.

You find a weird written directory. It's well-hidden enough, you might be able to come back and see it. You read:

ominous door

Assisted suicide is more rigorous and refined here and now than with Threediopolis's pilot program. A hundred years ago, the Death Panels there (not the healthcare kind, silly!) only gave punditly views on the how and why before you pegged out, but--the authorities realized nobody asked YOU! The person of the moment!
You're given surveys...questionnaires...what would you do better? What do you think authorities would do better? No, no, you are just lashing out because you are suicidal.  No, those free striped lollipops are for employees, not clients. You had plenty of time for a last meal before you walked in! Perhaps a moment to reconsider your one complaint here? If you're not in a rush? Ah, yes, you are not the first. Realizing others appreciate Fourdiopolis more than you could, and leaving more of its resources to them. Ah, yes, even the unsatisfied are satisfied in Fourdiopolis!

Someone tells a scary story for effect and, well, gets the effect they want.

>r

#testcase-scenery-table-of-scenery-3-hhh
>hhh
Someone threatens to body-slam another person for being utterly evil. Then--bam! You see they actually do! Someone whispers to you, don't worry, it's fake, just entertainment. What is the world coming to?

>r

#testcase-scenery-table-of-scenery-3-kkk

Everyone around here just really, really sucks at life. What else can I say?

Someone walking towards you tries to get out of your way, and you do the same. But you both pick the same way to go, several times. Awkward!

#testcase-scenery-table-of-scenery-4-keds

You feel a sudden stupid desire to buy overpriced sneakers. Maybe at Payless. But everyone shops at PayWayLess these days.

>r

#testcase-scenery-table-of-scenery-4-kwik

>r

#testcase-scenery-table-of-scenery-4-wind
>wind
You're almost blown off your feet for a second. Air currents in Fourdiopolis are weird--there's no PROOF the government controls them, but...

>r

#testcase-scenery-table-of-scenery-5-iknew
>iknew
Someone covers for looking stupid by explaining they were just being really, really ironic.

>r

#testcase-scenery-table-of-scenery-5-jesus
>jesus
Someone spouting an annoying proof that religions shouldn't exist then asks you to join the personality cult of a smart person dead for a hundred years, who wasn't nice, but they understood algorithms of how to make others nicer. You brush them away.

>r

#testcase-scenery-table-of-scenery-5-undid

>r

#testcase-scenery-table-of-scenery-5-whisk
>whisk
You trip on an odd cooking doohickey you forget the name of. People don't have time for making their own meals, with so much virtual reality to experience these days, and machines do it all well enough.

You see, and quickly ignore, some disturbing fliers on the ground.

>r

#testcase-scenery-table-of-scenery-6-shinju

Hmm, looks like a play, in the park. Not quite Romeo and Juliet, but seems like it just ended the same way.

>r

#testcase-scenery-table-of-scenery-6-shishe
>shishe
You smell evidence people are--gasp--SMOKING. You remember health warnings that a whiff of the good smelling stuff is worse than the bad smelling stuff, and vice versa.

>r

#testcase-scenery-table-of-scenery-6-unkind
>unkind
You hear a name. It's a slur. It's probably old, and maybe people forget why, but the nastiness still remains. It's the sort of thing the ubiquitous video cameras can't catch and report.

>r

#testcase-scenery-table-of-scenery-7-sissies
>sissies
Some self-made tough guys still feel a need to gang up on people weaker than they are. The pain's over sooner than if they went one at a time, amirite?

>r

#testcase-scenery-table-of-scenery-7-skidded

A government utility vehicle swerves and almost hits someone about to jaywalk. Funny how one is always around, unless you jaywalk REALLY assertively.

>r

#testcase-scenery-table-of-scenery-7-swedish

An ethnic area full of oddly dotted vowels. You know them by their Unicode numbers, but you have no clue how to pronounce them.

>r

#testcase-scenery-table-of-scenery-7-weenies
>weenies
An old long-abandoned hot dog hut lies between two places of Serious Business. Your grandparents constantly babbled about the misspelled version from THEIR youth being so tasty, and--well--maybe the misspelling did make things tastier.

#testcase-scenery-table-of-scenery-9-jeskiddin

Someone walks by and notifies you this is a Level 17 restricted area. You quickly hide your to-do list, before they point and laugh that they got you GOOD, and the grocery store's THAT way.

>r

#testcase-scenery-table-of-scenery-9-seediness

This area doesn't feel too posh. You don't know why, but it doesn't.

#testcase-scenery-table-of-scenery-9-whininess

You can zone out one complaint or two, but when it's all around, it's like it's contagious and you just won't put up with it! Really, some people! It's just not fair! You'd never...oops.

#testcase-scenery-table-of-scenery-9-wineskins
>wineskins
Everything retro is fashionable again, and drinking wine from animal skins was before when retro was a thing, so--that big rich people's gathering in the park is extra nice.
