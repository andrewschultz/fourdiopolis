dejeune|You sure could use a lunch break right now!
deke|You wonder if you faked yourself out going this way.
didi|A fellow with oversized glasses and suspenders runs into you, shrugs his shoulders, snort-laughs and then runs away.
die|> c|Assisted suicide is more rigorous and refined here and now than with Threediopolis's pilot program.|Ah, yes, even the unsatisfied are satisfied in Fourdiopolis!|> undo
dike|In this blocked-off area, people talk about the city water supply.
dindin|You feel hungry.
dink|You're hit by a very very soft nerf ball that runs away. Hmm.
duh|Oh, man! You can't believe you missed THAT one. It's obvious now!
dui|A robot-police runs by and grabs a breath-sample from the air in front of you. "Proceed," it says. Hmm.
eek|story for effect
ehhs|People keep asking fellow conversers to repeat themselves, here.
ennui|Yyyyyawn. What's the point?
heed|Some police give a particularly stern lecture to a citizen not fully obeying some minor law.
heehee|You think of a silly pun that feels funnier than it has a right to be.
hehhuh|Two fellows in a park, sitting on a couch, commenting stupidly at music videos on an old-school television. What is society coming to? Hah, you said...
henwen|You thought you heard a talking pig just now.
hues|The local color is particularly vibrant in this neighborhood.
huhheh|Two fellows in a park, sitting on a couch, commenting stupidly at music videos on an old-school television. What is society coming to? Hah, you said...
hush|Unusually quiet here.
ides|organized march
iknew|Someone covers for looking stupid by explaining they were just being really, really ironic.
inkiness|Everything's a bit cloudy, here.
iundidedu|wrangling
iundidjunk|wrangling
jesus|Someone spouting an annoying proof that religions shouldn't exist then asks you to join the personality cult of a smart person dead for a hundred years, who wasn't nice, but they understood algorithms of how to make others nicer. You brush them away.
juke|Awkward!
keds|You feel a sudden stupid desire to buy overpriced sneakers. Maybe at Payless. But everyone shops at PayWayLess these days.
kidniki|You temporarily feel on guard against the possibility of radical ninjas.
kidskin|You walk by an exotic leather store.
kike|Some kids call another kid a name. They try to convince him he can't be that made if he doesn't know what it means, or if it's a really old insult before it's over. You want to step in and help the poor kid but you don't know how.
kkk|Everyone around here just really, really sucks at life. What else can I say?
knees|You grab an old ache for a moment.
kuskunn|You see an image of a demon trapped in a bubble, by a candle slowly burning.
nike|You feel a sudden stupid desire to buy overpriced sneakers. Maybe at Payless. But everyone shops at PayWayLess these days.
nisei|You walk past shops with Japanese signs.
nissin|You step on something. It looks like a chunk of dried noodles. You feel hungry for food you'll regret later.
nudies|You see, and quickly ignore, some disturbing fliers on the ground.
nuhuh|A trivial argument nearby quickly turns emotional.
seediness|This area doesn't feel too posh. You don't know why, but it doesn't.
seek|You spy someone else with a sheet similar to yours. You don't acknowledge them, though. Can't be too careful.
seine|You feel a hackneyed flavor of, and longing for, Gay Paree.
shinju|Hm, looks like a play, in the park. Not quite Romeo and Juliet, but seemes like it just ended the same way.
shins|You grab an old ache for a moment.
shishe|You smell evidence people are--gasp--SMOKING. You remember health warnings that a whiff of the good smelling stuff is worse than the bad smelling stuff, and vice versa.
shun|You feel very, very alone. People are more than just giving you your space.
shush|"Oh, sure, you can THINK that, just don't SAY it, you know?"
sides|You feel cornered in here. You're not sure why.
sissies|Some self-made tough guys still feel a need to gang up on people weaker than they are. The pain's all over at once that way, amirite?
skidded|A goverment utility vehicle swerves and almost hits someone about to jaywalk. Funny how one is always around, unless you jaywalk REALLY assertively.
skinniness|You are momentarily bombarded with ads for diet plans.
skunkweed|It smells bad here, like it should be illegal.
uhhs|Conversation feels a bit slower and dumber than usual for Fourdiopolis, for a second here.
undid|You feel regret for what you've done and regret for that regret. You waste a bit of time fretting over how you've wasted a bit of time no matter which feeling is right.
unkind|You worry someone's going to do something mean to you, but don't worry, they're only thinking about it. Especially with video cameras all around.
unkissed|You hear a teen sob about their lack of romantic luck.
uuid|You are suddenly unable to get the hexadecimal number
weenies|An old long-abandoned hot dog hut lies between two places of Serious Business. Your grandparents constantly babbled about the misspelled version from THEIR youth being so tasty, and--well--maybe the misspelling did make things tastier.
whew|You just barely escaped something, there! You don't know what, but it would've been pretty bad.
whininess|zone out one complaint
whiskies|You trip on an odd cooking doohickey you forget the name of. People don't have time for making their own meals, with so much virtual reality to experience these days, and machines do it all well enough.|Wow! People seem to be having a rip roaring time, here
winded|You're almost blown off your feet for a second. Air currents in Fourdiopolis are weird--there's no PROOF the government controls them, but...|You take a break to catch your breath.
wineskins|Everything retro is fashionable again, and drinking wine from animal skins was before when retro was a thing, so--that big rich people's gathering in the park is extra nice.
