>x me
You don't look particularly odd, but authorities and such have always said there's something suspicious about you. Lately, you've sort of wished there was.
>x me
You should blend in nicely with the scenery for all the tasks you need to do.

>x transporter
You review the literature on the transporter about the three approved teleport directions: h, i, j and k, and something about quaternions, and something else about how you can't have people passing each other in opposite directions in a teleportal field, or BAM. It's all pretty standard stuff, and if people can't understand it, they look knowledgeable nodding their heads about it.
It has the letters I, J, K and H in a rough circle

>x transporter
!quaternions
It has the letters I, J, K and H in a rough circle

>enter transporter
That's a bit ambiguous. Try going h, i, j or k, instead.

>exit
Out? Of Fourdiopolis? You don't have proper documentation. And you can't get it. Well, not in this game.

>north
In these efficient days, people find using more than one letter for a direction too flowery.

You can't cut through buildings on your own. Even with teleporters being all the rage. Well, apparently you could cut through some lobbies years ago, but surveillance and keycard-doors have taken care of that.

>undo
You can't really quite reverse how and where you walked, or when you teleported. Worse, Fourdiopolis is no closer to time travel than Threediopolis, but it's a lot closer to proving time travel's impossible.
But don't worry, if you get killed somehow, you will be able to undo. And you can always zap back to the center and retrace your steps.

>wf 0

>enter
Nothing to enter.

>yes
Not much to say yes to--rhetorical questions are for narrative purposes, and yes/no questions will be specifically prompted that way.

>l
You look around, hoping for some weird fifth dimension, or eleventh direction, to look for something significant. You don't find it.

>o
I didn't recognize that verb. You can type A for the actions available. None should be too complex.

>g
That would actually make getting around in Fourdiopolis more complex. Because you can't really move from there to here, again, or not that way. You'll understand once you find a few things--it'd just allow all kinds of extra crazy guesses. Using one-word directions should be quick enough.

>sleep
There's laws against that. Well, there are no laws against sleeping, but sleeping in possession of valuables encourages criminals. Sleeping without them is vagrancy.

>shit
The old swear words have a certain charm, even though a language commission established new previously nonsensical words as more neurologically effective.

>bother
The government approves of such restraint in frustration.

>x
There's a note scribbled in that you probably have to use a transporter to get to any of these places.

Hey! It's that hideout you stumbled on! Well, one of the two!

The hideout where you got your tasks from is nearby.

Yup, you recognize it now. You just need to look carefully--but not too carefully so others get curious.

>iiii
You pick up the pace
>r
You take one of the public teleporters back to the center. You don't need a special key. They're about the only thing free these days. The government, in a small sop to civil liberties, doesn't even track how many times a person uses it. Small things.

>r
You're already at

>n
>r
You only just left the center. You're a little worried that if you use the transporters TOO frequently, you might get tracked somehow. Maybe with a bit more experience and confidence, you can sneak back quickly.

>n
>r
Maybe explore another block before hitting the transporters--you're not quite experienced or confident enough to do so yet. Using the transporters too frequently raises red flags.

Your journey this time was very short, but no point wandering if it's off to a bad start.

>nsns

You remember hearing that anywhere worth getting to, you had to teleport to. And you didn't, this run.
A short journey, but maybe you discovered something to do. Or not-do.

>nsnsn

A kind of short journey, good for exercise and sightseeing.

>nsnsns

A kind of long journey this time.

>nsnsnsn

A long journey. You're glad you're in shape so you can walk this much. Or maybe you've walked so much and you're now in shape. That's the sort of thing you think about during long walks.

>eweweweh
>r
It's been a very long walk indeed.
You don't know if they'd make you wander THIS much in order to find something. Perhaps you should stick with as short journeys as possible.

>nsnsnsnsn
>r
This walk has been extra long. You sense the further you went, the less likely you were to find something.
