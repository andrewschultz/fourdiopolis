Fourdiopolis release 3 has minor bug fixes and enhancements that piled up. There are no changes in actual puzzles.

The official release date is March 20, 2017.

--minor considerable speedups in traversing (scenery tables are now broken up by how far away everything is)
--when the game gives you a deliberately unreachable location in the random comments, I'm sure it is, now, and just barely, too
--the start/restart now check your progress so you don't get the long text from when you start the game
