# fourdiopolis
post-comp repository for my Spring Thing 2016 game

The original release was in April 2016. The second (and final release with major features) is slated for July 2016.

Fourdiopolis builds oon Threediopolis's code base. It also used Zarf's python regression testing scripts extensively to weed out bugs.
