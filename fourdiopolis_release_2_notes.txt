Fourdiopolis release 2 has a lot of bug fixes and enhancements. The core game is still the same, but I was able to add a few neat things.

I was able to use Zarf's script to do stability testing, which was a big help, and it also turned up--and left me freer to look into--small bugs and inconsistencies in the narrative, which I was able to fix.

--the game now detects how you run out of bounds for a more suitable error message.
--the commands to go forward and backward through the game (clearing one tast list or resetting it) have been sharpened. They are also all UNDOable.
----you can now specifically solve or un-solve each of the three random middle scenarios
--game state corruption is also detected if you edit the GLKDATA file wrong.
--72 pieces of scenery, up from 43
--46 silly events, up from 33
--A(ction) command now reveals TECH, which was guess-the-verb in the Spring Thing version
--the final scenario is now tilted a bit differently towards the shadow leaders' campaign offices and not their homes. Also, lots of randomized text for names without any specific bad jokes.
--35 last names now, up from 30. I think they blend a bit better and clue the next one. More nationality clues too.
--the game now slightly heckles you with a few unreachable locations here and there in random text
